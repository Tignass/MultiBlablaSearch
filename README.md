# How to use
* In "from" (and "to") fill the locations you want to search.
* Fill the prefered date for your trip (in the field bellow "From")
* Click on "R. 1 Jour" if you want to look for only one day ("R. 2 jour" for two days,...)
* You can either click on individual links (which will open in new tab) or click copy all the textArea field, then click on "openmultipleurl", paste it there and click on "go now" to open all the urls.
* You can see distances between the first location and the others (for each "To" and "From" fields), on Google map
